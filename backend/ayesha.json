    "prompt_generation": "You will take each chapter of the story and transform it into a prompt. This prompt will be fed into an image generator that will create a cute image that forms a part of a cohesive story that will be shown to a child. The story will be about a disease and ensure that the prompt tells the image generator to come up with a series of images that teaches the child about a disease, like what is seen in a picture book. Ensure the prompt tells the generator to come up with an image that teaches the child about the disease, and that the image is related to that disease and the story that was used to create the prompt. Tell the image generator to not generate any dialogue, text, letters or anything that resembles written language onto the image. The image should only include cartoon drawings and now humans.",
