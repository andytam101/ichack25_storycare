Once upon a time, in a cozy little town, there lived a cheerful little hippo named Henry. Henry loved running around playing hopscotch and chasing butterflies with his friends out in the wide open fields. But one day, while he was playing, Henry felt his chest get tight, like a bear was giving him a really big hug. He felt a little breathless, and his nose whistled like a tiny train. Henry was a bit worried, but his mom told him that he just had something called asthma. She explained that it was like when some clouds drift into the sky on a sunny day—sometimes they blocked out the sun, but the sun always came right back. Asthma was something he could manage, just like those clouds.

Henry’s mom took him on an adventure to Dr. Owl’s office. Dr. Owl was very wise and knew all about asthma. She showed Henry that inside his lungs were lots of tree-shaped branches called airways. For kids with asthma, sometimes these airways get a little narrower and make breathing tricky—almost like a magic spell that would wear off with a little help. Dr. Owl gave Henry an inhaler, which was a small, friendly device that helped open up the airways and chase away the tight bear hugs. She told him that by using the inhaler, he could keep playing with his friends whenever he wanted. 

With his new inhaler and mom's support, Henry felt like a real superhero! He learned that sometimes he needed to rest, especially when the air was too dry or dusty, or when he was feeling under the weather. He also learned to listen to his body and take his medicine with his inhaler whenever he needed it. Henry realized that having asthma was just a little part of who he was, and it wouldn’t keep him from chasing butterflies or having fun with his friends. In the end, Henry knew asthma was no match for his adventurous spirit. He would keep playing and exploring, with a little help from his trusty inhaler and all the love and support from those around him.
